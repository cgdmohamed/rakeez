## Task: Apply Professional Brand Identity Across Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard needs to be redesigned visually to look professional, consistent, and aligned with the official **Rakeez Brand Guidelines**.

---

### 1. Sidebar Navigation
- Fix **link colors** (currently unreadable: white text on light background).  
- Use **brand colors** for navigation states:
  - Default: Dark Blue (`#00269A`).  
  - Active/Selected: Cyan (`#6BDAD5`) background with bold white text.  
  - Hover: Light blue background with Dark Blue text.  
- Add subtle icons aligned with each label (Bookings, Quotations, Payments, etc.), matching brand style.

### 2. Tables (All Pages: Bookings, Quotations, Payments, Wallets, Spare Parts, Support, etc.)
- Use **alternating row colors** (white / light gray) for better readability.  
- Apply **badges with brand colors** for statuses:
  - Bookings:  
    - Pending ‚Üí Orange badge  
    - In Progress ‚Üí Cyan badge  
    - Completed ‚Üí Green badge  
    - Cancelled ‚Üí Red badge  
  - Payments: Paid (Green), Failed (Red), Pending (Orange).  
  - Wallets: Credit (Green), Debit (Red).  
  - Support Tickets: Open (Blue), In Progress (Orange), Closed (Gray).  
- Right-align numeric values (Price, Total, Stock).  
- Use consistent table headers with bold Dark Blue text.

---

### 3. Buttons & Actions
- Replace plain icons with **styled buttons**:
  - Primary actions: Dark Blue (`#00269A`) with white text.  
  - Secondary: Cyan (`#6BDAD5`).  
  - Destructive: Red.  
- Add tooltips for clarity (e.g., ‚ÄúEdit Service‚Äù, ‚ÄúDelete Spare Part‚Äù).  
- Place primary action buttons (Add, Create, Save) at the top-right, styled with strong brand colors.

### 4. Brand Colors & Typography
- Apply the official palette:
  - **Dark Blue:** `#00269A` (Primary)  
  - **Cyan:** `#6BDAD5` (Accent)  
  - **Green:** `#45D492`  
  - **Light Green:** `#CBE880`  
- Headings ‚Üí Bold Dark Blue.  
- Body text ‚Üí Neutral dark gray/black.  
- Use consistent font sizes (e.g., h1 = 24px bold, h2 = 18px semibold, body = 14‚Äì16px regular).

---

### 5. Global UX Enhancements
- Add **Loading states** (spinner or skeleton loader).  
- Add **Empty states** (e.g., ‚ÄúNo bookings found‚Äù with a friendly illustration in brand colors).  
- Ensure **consistent spacing** and card styling (rounded corners, subtle shadows).  
- Make pages **responsive**: sidebar collapses to icons on small screens.

---

### 6. Branding Elements
- Replace placeholder logos with official **SVG logo** (from brand package).  
- Replace current currency symbol with the official **SVG currency symbol**.  
- Ensure favicon, login screen, and dashboard header use official branding.
