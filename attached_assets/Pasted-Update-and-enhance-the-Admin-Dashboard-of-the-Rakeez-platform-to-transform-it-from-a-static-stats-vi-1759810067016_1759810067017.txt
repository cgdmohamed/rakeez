Update and enhance the Admin Dashboard of the Rakeez platform to transform it from a static stats view into a fully interactive operational analytics panel.
Do not change the general layout or color scheme — keep it aligned with the Rakeez branding — but improve the depth, structure, and user experience to match enterprise-grade dashboards.

🎯 Primary Goal

Make the Admin Dashboard a central operational and analytical hub that lets administrators:

Monitor live performance (KPIs, revenue, technician efficiency).

Act quickly (approve bookings, assign technicians, handle refunds).

Gain insights through trends and behavioral data.

🧭 Section 1 – KPIs & Performance Cards

Expand the top cards to include the following:

Pending Bookings – highlighted in amber (color warning).

Active / In Progress Orders – total count and total value.

Technician Performance – number of completed jobs and average rating.

Uncollected Payments / Wallet Totals – shows revenue not yet settled.

Top Service Demand – short summary of most booked service this month.

📊 Section 2 – Analytics Charts & Trends

Upgrade the charts area to display multi-metric analytics for the last 6 months:

Revenue vs Expenses line chart.

Bookings by Source (pie chart – app / web / referrals).

Customer Growth Curve (new users per month).

Referral Performance (total discount cost + new customers acquired).

All charts must be dynamic and refresh from the latest API data without page reload.

⚙️ Section 3 – Operational Insights

Add interactive widgets:

Recent Activity Feed – latest bookings, refunds, support tickets, wallet updates.

Alerts & Tasks Widget – “3 pending bookings need approval”, “1 technician delayed”, etc.

Quick Actions Panel – buttons for “Create Booking”, “Assign Technician”, “Issue Refund”.

Each action should open a modal instead of redirecting the user.

🧩 Section 4 – Deep Integration

Make every stat card and chart clickable and redirect to its related management page:

Card / Chart	Target Page
Total Orders	Bookings page (All)
Pending Bookings	Bookings page (Pending)
Completed	Bookings page (Completed)
Revenue	Payments page
Technician Performance	Technicians management page
Referral Stats	Promos / Referrals analytics tab
💅 Section 5 – UX/UI Enhancements

Unify padding, margins, and title colors with the rest of the app.

Add light micro-animations on cards and charts for smooth loading.

Replace “$” symbol with “SAR” and Rakeez currency icon.

Add small tooltips on hover (e.g., “This month vs previous month trend”).

Keep the dashboard fully responsive and maintain RTL compatibility.

🧮 Section 6 – Data Integrity & Reporting

All data must come from live API endpoints (/api/v2/admin/overview, /bookings/stats, /wallet/summary, etc.).

Ensure real-time numbers reflect true pending, completed, and cancelled records.

Add a mini report export option (CSV or PDF) summarizing weekly KPIs.

Include error state handling (empty data, loading, API failure).

📘 Deliverables

Upgraded Admin Dashboard interface with all new sections integrated.

Dynamic real-time data binding with auto-refresh (no manual reload).

Clickable navigation links to underlying pages.

Consistent Rakeez branding and RTL support.

Final UI/UX review report confirming layout and data accuracy.
